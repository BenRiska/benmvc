# benmvc
initial commit

Hi and welcome to the BenMVC Framework

Version 1.0.0

It is a basic php mvc framework that can be used as a foundation for different types of apps.

For example my Shareposts app that you can find among my github repositories. 

I made this framework to get som experience creating an mvc, feel free to use it in your own projects.
